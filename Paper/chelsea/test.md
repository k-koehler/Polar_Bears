1\. Introduction and Background

Oil and petroleum products, such as gasoline, are nonrenewable,
important commodities that are a major component in the everyday life of
people worldwide. Originating mostly from Alberta and Saskatchewan, 450,
000 tons of oil and products are consumed daily in Canada, most of which
is used for transportation (Fringas, capp). Crude oil is naturally
formed over millions of years from decayed organic bodies of marine
organisms combined with intense heat and pressure (national). Varying in
compositions, crude oil and products are composed of thousands of
distinct compounds, such as hydrocarbons and metals, which give it
unique characteristics that will influence how it will behave in
specific environments (national research council).

As the demand for energy has increased globally, the consumption of oil
has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the 20^th^ century
(Ledenko 2018). Future demands for oil, as a non-renewable source, may
cause overexploitation of the Earth's oil reserves as well as economic
unrest with fluctuating oil prices (Own 2010).

Two ways in which crude oil can enter marine environments is through
anthropogenic activities and crude oil seeps, the latter having occurred
naturally throughout Earth's history (hunt 1996). However, with the high
demands faced by the oil and gas industries, it comes to no surprise
that pollution, via oil spills, has occurred during transport and
extract of crude oil in marine environments. It is estimated that up to
50% of spills are caused directly or indirectly by human error or
equipment malfunction (Fingas). Just in the past century, several
large-scale oil spills have occurred, one of which became the largest to
date. In April 2010, over 200 million gallons of oil was spilled during
the *Deepwater Horizon* oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico, which was 19
times more than the pervious large-scale *Exxon Valdez* oil spill in
1989 (pop mechanics). Although there has been a decline in oil spills
since 1992, studies focusing on large-scale spills have reported major
environmental changes in marine ecosystems, such as disruption of
photosynthesis by marine vegetation, increases in mortality rates of
benthic organisms and changes in marine biogeochemical cycles (Musk,
Mendelssohn, bae).

In terms of remediation of large-scale oil spills, several physical,
chemical and biological methods are available. However, with global
climate and pollution issues rising, recent emphasis has been placed on
the development of environmentally sustainable clean-up methods that
follow green chemistry standards. Green chemistry is the use of
sustainable, safe and non-polluting practices in chemical science, with
the overall goal creating minimal waste while using the least amounts of
energy and materials (Manahan). For example, one of the most common
chemical and environmentally controversial tools used in large-scale oil
spills are dispersants. When released, dispersants dilute large oil
spills and disperse tiny oil droplets throughout marine environments,
which can facilitate microbial biodegradation by providing them with a
rich source of hydrocarbons (butler). On the other hand,

Numerous studies have taken place to understand the short and long-term
impacts of large-scale oil spills in aquatic communities, such as the
Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill. Only by fully understanding the impacts of
oil in marine environments, advancements in effective, fast and
economically feasible remediation methods can occur. This paper aims to
summarize reported environments impacts of large-scale oil spills,
review current clean-up methods and discuss current advancements in
sustainable physical clean-up methods.

2\. Results and Discussion

**2.1. Environmental Impacts of Oil Spills**

**Large-scale oil spills have the potential to affect many aquatic
communities and species.**

**2.1.1. Impacts in Coast Regions**

Due to movement by winds and ocean currents, oil spills can alter a
variety of aquatic communities by affecting the plant and wildlife
species that live within them. Through examination of coastal benthic
community changes before and after the *Deepwater Horizon* spill, major
impacts have been reported regarding the community structure across the
Gulf of Mexico (Bik et. all). Although the presence of oil is visibly
absent, shifts from high species richness to low richness following the
oil spill was found in fungal and nematode populations (bik). Changes in
the benthic community structure could impact higher tropic levels,
leading to alterations in food webs (bik). Another example needed to
fully understand the impacts of oil spills on intertidal coastal regions
is through evaluation of valuable mangrove wetlands. As oil is washed up
into costal regions, it readily binds onto the oleophilic surfaces of
mangrove vegetation, subsequently smothering, poisoning and killing them
(Duke). Severity of the oil spill plays a large role in the likeliness
of recovery in mangrove communities since oil impacts vary between
species, in some cases communities can recover while others may not
(Duke). Although environmental impacts have been found, it is not always
the case that dramatic impacts in costal regions are reported following
oils spill. For example, a study by Edgar and colleagues, that analyzed
the environmental impacts of the *Jessica* oil spill on shore
communities in the Galápagos Islands, found no detectable oil effects.
The effects of oil spills depend heavily on the amount of oil spilled,
weather conditions, prevailing winds and the composition of the
shoreline community itself (Edgar 2003, Lin 2012).

2.1.2 Impacts of Mammalian Species

Large-scale oil spills can directly or indirectly impact mammals that
live within or depend on aquatic environments. Direct effects include
degradation of habitat and physical alterations resulting from direct
contact with oil; while indirect effects include behavioral alterations
and changes in prey availability (fingas, Ridoux ). However, the effects
of oil spills on mammals heavily depends on species sensitivity, life
stage, mobility and recovery potential (fingas).

Similar to other pollutants, there may be a risk of oil bioaccumulation
in lower trophic levels that could indirectly affect mammalian food
sources. For example, by feeding heavily contaminated mussel species
from the *Erika* oil spill of the French Atlantic coast, DNA damage in
the liver and bone marrow of rats was observed (lemiere). However,
Lemiere's study could not clearly assume that only the hydrocarbons
found in the oil caused the DNA damage. Other contaminants, such as
methyl chrysenes and thiophenes may have played a role in the damage
observed in rats. On the other hand, some mammal species appear to be
virtually unaffected by the *Erika* oil spill. Through assessment of
mortality rates, trace elements and diet, no effects were observed in
dolphin and seal populations along the coast of France (Ridoux). It is
possible that this difference in oil spill affects can be related to the
mobility of species. Mussels are relatively immobile, therefore facing
the most effects from oil spills in aquatic environments.

**2.2. Oil Remediation Methods and their Effects**

**When selecting appropriate clean-up methods that will remove the most
amount of oil possible, the properties of oil must be considered in
order to understand its behavior in aquatic ecosystems. As discussed
earlier, the composition of oil plays a large role in its physical
characteristics, such as viscosity, density and solubility (national
research centre). For example, oils with high or low viscosity, do not
readily form water-in-oil emulsions, which are known to drastically
increase the volume of oil spills (Fingas 2012 not book). Composition
and type are not the only challenging factors in oil spill clean-ups;
additionally, weather and sea conditions should also be considered to
select fast and effective methods (Hoang). Once the factors influencing
the behaviour of oil in aquatic environments are identified, selection
of appropriate physical, chemical and biological clean-up methods can be
made.**

**2.2.1. Preventative Measures**

**Although they do not directly remove oil from aquatic environments,
booms are typically the first step in oil spill remediation. Booms,
resembling curtains that extend below and above waterlines, serve as a
mechanical tool that contains and prevents spread of oil on water
(Fingas). Blooms consist of several distinct sections which can be made
from a variety of materials, such as nylon and polyester (fingas). There
are generally three categories of blooms: fence, curtain and shoreline,
with their effectiveness heavily depending on water currents, wind and
waves.**

**2.2.2. In-situ Burning**

**In-situ burning is a time-efficient, one-step method that involves
controlled burning of oil on water surfaces (fingas). Using
fire-resistant booms, oil can be contained in a specific area and
undergo repeated burnings (Betts). In-situ burning allows for less
equipment, less labour and no secondary processing of oil tools, such as
sorbents, to take place (fingas). In order for in-situ burning to be
efficient, oil slick thickness was determined to be most affective
between 10-22 mm, however, oil composition may play a role in maximum
efficiency (Geldnen). Problems associated with in-situ burning is the
production of large toxic smoke plumes and residues that can negatively
affect surrounding wildlife and benthic environments (office of,
fingas). For example, a study on seabird plumage found that along with
fresh oil, in situ burning residues have a similar or even more negative
effects (Rasmussen).**

**2.2.3. Skimmers**

**The first true physical method of oil remediation to be discussed is
the use of skimmers on surface water. Similar to booms, the
effectiveness of skimmers not only depends on weather and wind
conditions, but oil heaviness and the amount of debris present also
plays a large role (fingas). Several types of skimmers are available,
such as oleophilic, weir and vacuum. Oleophilic skimmers are available
in a variety of forms, such as belt, disk, and drum, however all
essentially function in a similar way. The rotating surface of skimmers
has adsorbent properties in which oil adheres to and is separated from
surface waters (keller). Although oleophilic skimmers perform well in
debris-filled and ice water, the process can be very time consuming and
expensive (keller). Generally, the water-in-take of oleophilic processes
are minimal since only the oil itself is bound the device (fingas).
Unlike oleophilic skimmers, that depend on adsorbent characteristics of
oil, weir skimmers use gravity to facilitate oil separation instead
(cite?). In this form of oil remediation, oil on the surface of water is
pulled and collected into storage tanks (hammoud). In most cases, weir
skinners require calm waters and light to medium weight oils for maximum
efficiency (fingas). Finally, vacuum skimmers are floating devices that
suck oil from water surfaces and deposit it into a storage tank (epa).
In most cases, vacuum skimmers perform better in calm waters, but can
easily become clogged from debris in shallow waters (epa, fingas).**

**2.2.4. Sorbents**

**Through adsorption and absorption properties, sorbents are a form of
physical and chemical methods that facilitate the change from liquid to
semi-solid phases in oil spills, making contaminants easier to remove
from aquatic environments (Saskikala). The goal of sorbent use is to
remove oil from surface waters quickly and efficiently, to prevent oil
accumulation in aquatic environments (Paulauskiene). Oil recovery and
water in-take are two main factors that determine the efficiency, and
therefore the use of specific sorbents in oil spill clean-ups (fingas).
Generally, sorbents can be divided into three categories: organic,
inorganic and synthetic, each with their own advantages and
disadvantages. For example, synthetic sorbents are often used in oil
spill clean-ups due to their oleophilic and hydrophobic properties
(adebajo). In fact, synthetic sorbents often outperform organic and
inorganic sorbents in oil recovery percentage, as shown in Table 1. Even
with various oil types differing in weight, synthetic sorbents had oil
recovery percentages of 90+, while inorganic and organic only reached
80+. Although naturally less efficient, many inorganic and organic
sorbents can be treated to increase their oleophilic and hydrophobic
properties (fingas). However, some problems are associated with sorbent
use, such as post-processing of sorbent materials, reusability, sinking
and durability (saskikala).**

**2.2.5. Dispersants**

**Dispersants are a form of chemical oil spill remediation, in which
it's effectiveness and environmental impacts are highly debated. Through
injection into aquatic environments, dispersants reduce oil-size and
stabilize small-sized droplets, enhancing the rate of oil biodegradation
by bacteria (Respar). During the *Deepwater Horizon* oil-spill, more
than 7 million liters of Corexit dispersants were released into the Gulf
of Mexico (respare, kleindienst).**

**Many argue that the release of such large amounts of dispersants was
unnecessary because of their lack of biodegradation stimulation and
potential environmental effects. Under laboratory settings, Kleindienst
and collogues examined the effects of dispersants on microbial
communities and their degradation rates. Through measurement of alkane
and aromatic hydrocarbon oxidation rates in crude oil, the researchers
determined that the highest levels of degradation occurred without the
use of dispersants. In fact, it was noted that dispersants negatively
altered the microbial community by selecting against the most effective
degrading organisms. Through assessment of degradation by alkane and
aromatic bacterial cultures in crude and weathered oil, an experiment by
Rahsepar supported Kleindienst. By using various dispersant to oil
ratios, Rahsepar determined that increased aromatic solubility,
facilitated by application of dispersants, led to higher aromatic
concentration in water. Inhibition in degradation of these aromatic
compounds took place when aromatic degrading organisms were not present,
leading to inhibition of oil degradation. Rahsepar concluded the
composition of the bacterial community in aquatic environments is the
main factor in oil degradation and that addition of oil dispersants can
inhibit degradation.**

**Conversely, Kleindienst's experimental method was criticized for
testing degradation only by using oil floating on water surfaces, since
this is rarely the case in aquatic environments (prince1). In terms of
other studies, Prince also argued that many, are not carried out long
enough and that the oil used are in such low concentrations that it can
be easily dispersed, thus allowing rapid degradation without using
dispersants. Prince argued that in order to accurately test the effects
of dispersants on oil degradation, experiments should compare degrading
between dispersed oil in the water column and oil floating on water
surfaces. By comparing untreated oil floating on surface waters and
dispersant-treated oil in the water column, Prince concluded that
dispersants highly stimulate the rate of biodegradation with additions
of dispersants.**

**2.3. Sustainable Advancements in Oil Spill Remediation**

**Of the available remediation methods for large-scale oil spills that
could, sorbents seem to be the most promising in terms of green
chemistry. The research and development of many reusable sorbents
appears to be on the rise and will be discussed in this section.**

**2.3.1. Synthetic and Natural Sorbents**

**Recently, the use of natural, renewable sorbents has been highly
studied in green chemistry literature. Cork, being one of the more
recently studied and promising sorbents, has been found to be a
successful alternative for sustainable oil clean-up. Cork, that is heat
and pressure treated to increase its hydrophobic and absorption
properties, is derived naturally from the bark of the Cork Oak
(Fonseca). By comparing the sorption of corks cells with oils varying in
viscosity, Todescato et al. determined that as viscosity increased, so
did the capacity of cork recovery, making it suitable for heavy oil
clean-ups, such as lubricating oil. The researchers also determined that
even when mechanically compressed and reused up to 30 times, the oil
recovery in the cork cells remained high at approximately 80%. However,
when compared to cotton and polypropylene sorbents, cork was
outperformed in both sorption rate and capacity, but had better oil
retention and floatability (Abreu). Other natural sorbents of interest
which have been involved in recent research include peat, straw, wool
and moss. When comparing the sorption capacity of these various natural
sorbents and their composites in different oil-type spills, Paulauskiene
and Jucike determined that each behaved very differently. While in crude
oil, wool had the highest sorption capacity, compared to peat having the
highest sorption capacity in diesel oil (cite?). When composites were
evaluated, the straw/peat sorbent, with a ratio of 1:4, absorbed
approximately 65% of both crude and diesel oil. From the research of
natural sorbents, it can be concluded that their use is heavily
dependent on oil type, their behaviour in water and availability of
materials.**

**Perhaps, another method to clean-up oil spills in an environmentally
sustainable manner, is through alteration of existing sorbents. As
stated earlier, synthetic sorbents tend to be selected over inorganic
and organic sorbents because of their oleophilic and hydrophobic
properties. Through bulk polymerization of glycerol propoxylate and ICS
monomer cross-linkers, a more efficient sorbent gel, in terms of
sorption capacity, sorption time, specificity and reusability, was
created (kizil). What makes this research significant in a green
chemistry perspective, is that Kizil and Sonmez synthesized this highly
efficient sorbent without the use of initiators, activators, solvents or
catalysts. Another example of sorbent alteration is the through
successive treatment with silica sol and gasoline to create a highly
efficient sorbent from inexpensive and readily available polyurethane
sponges (Wu). Wu and collogues found this new sorbent to have high
sorption capacity in various oil-types, while absorbing negligible
amounts of waters. The modified polyurethane was also found to be
reusable up to 15 times, with approximately 70% sorption capacity
remaining. Finally, synthetic sorbents developed from industrial wastes
has also been explored. In 2018, a polysulfide polymer sorbent was
created from sulfur waste and unsaturated cooking oils (Worthington).
Worthington and collogues determined this new sorbent to have high
sorption rates, high sorption time and easy reusability. Of the
synthesized sorbents available, the polysulfide sorbent appears to be
the most promising in sustainable chemistry, due to its low-cost, high
efficiency and origination from industrial wastes (cite?).**

**Finally, sorbent booms, similar to regular booms, are used to contain
large-scale oil spills while also absorbing or adsorbing contaminants
through the use of sorbent materials on their surface (fingas). Although
there has been a recent interest of organic/natural sorbents, there
appears to be a lack of literature regarding the use of sorbents in
mechanical booms. For example, an experiment by Pagnucco and Phillips
found that hair used in sorbent booms were more efficient and had a
higher sorption capacity than several sorbents, including the synthetic
and popular sorbent, polypropylene. On the other hand, the experiment
also confirmed the beneficial hydrophobic properties of synthetic
materials, as polypropylene was found to absorb less water compared to
the hair boom. In terms of green chemistry, this study confirms the
comparability of natural sorbent booms as a sustainable alternative to
synthetic booms, therefore more research in this area should be take
place**

**When making environmentally conscious decisions, trade-offs, such as
oil sorption rate, capacity, and retention, can influence the selection
of synthetic and natural sorbents in oil spill remediation. In some
situations when oil spills need immediate remediation, natural sorbents
may be better suited compared to synthetic sorbents, that may need to be
synthesized. On the other hand, highly efficient and reusable sorbents
may only be achieved through synthetization. Nevertheless, development
of sustainable clean-up materials seems to be well underway with
potential in making selection between sustainable and non-sustainable
methods obsolete.**

4\. Conclusions

**As discussed, numerous oil spill remediation methods exist, such as
skimmers, sorbents and dispersants. With recent global emphasis on
environmentally sustainable procedures in all forms of chemical
processing, the improvement of physical methods seems the most feasible
and acceptable for large-scale oil spills. However, several variables
apply that determines which sorbent material can be used, such as water
conditions, oil type and local rules and regulations. There seems to be
many trade offs associated with sustainable methods, such as reduced oil
sorption vs. better oil retention in cork sorbents, that can influence
the selection of materials.**

2.4. Formatting of Mathematical Components

This is an example of an equation:

a = 1,

\(1\)

the text following an equation need not be a new paragraph. Please
punctuate equations as regular text.

Theorem-type environments (including propositions, lemmas, corollaries
etc.) can be formatted as follows:

***Theorem 1.*** Example text of a theorem. Theorems, propositions,
lemmas, *etc.* should be numbered sequentially (i.e., Proposition 2
follows Theorem 1). Examples or Remarks use the same formatting, but
should be numbered separately, so a document may contain Theorem 1,
Remark 1 and Example 1.

The text continues here. Proofs must be formatted as follows:

**Proof of Theorem 1.** Text of the proof. Note that the phrase 'of
Theorem 1' is optional if it is clear which theorem is being referred
to. Always finish a proof with the following symbol. □
